    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Product Name: AviWeather</p>
    <p>This will be a product that will be a weather-themed website. It will be interactive, with a weather guide of some sort and a quiz function.</p>
    
    <h2>Meet the Team</h2>
    <p>The team is made up of me and me alone! My team of one will work hard to get this project rocking and rolling!</p>
    
    <h2>Application Overview</h2>
    <p>From the end user's perspective, the website will have tabs to store a informational guide and a cloud quiz. See if you can get the cloud right!</p>

    <h2>Technical Overview</h2>
    <p>From a programming perspective, it will utilize HTML and CSS to create the website. Further languages, such as JavaScript may be used for more interaction.</p>
    <p>It will be hosted on Azure and will utilize Git.</p>

    <h2>Feature List</h2>
    <p> The main feature will be the interactive quiz and guide on weather terminology.</p>
    <p> Future Outlook: Adding a radar feature would be a fun implementation! </p>

    <h2>Technical Feature List</h2>
    <p>The technical features will be hosting the website itself and utilizing CSS to make the webpage look astheically pleasing.</p>
    <p>Advanced technical features could possibly be the radar functions, if time allows. This would be done through JavaScript. There are some guides on the internet to help me to achieve this!</p>
